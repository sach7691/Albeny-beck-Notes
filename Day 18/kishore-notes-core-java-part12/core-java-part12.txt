What is Serialization?

A process of writing an object's state to a byte stream

Process of storing class objects into a byte stream

	To implement Serialization we need two classes 
	
		1) FileOutputStream 
		
		2) ObjectOutputStream
		
		
		
	NOTE:******** Only the objects of class that implements "Serializable" interface can be serialized
	
	

What is a De-Serialization?

A process of reading objects from a byte stream

	To implement De-Serialization we need two classes 
	
	
		1) FileInputStream 
		
		2) ObjectInputStream
