What is an environment variable?

Can set some global variable across users.
global variable can be access from anywhere

----------------------------------------------
what is java specification?
It describes all aspects of the language, including the semantics of all types, statements, and expressions, as well as threads and binary compatibility

-----------------------------------------

List of java specifications

1. java SE (Standard Edition)
used to develop stand-alone/desktop/window-based application

Mainly focus on core and intermidiate java concepts
(Desktop app is called a stand-alone application)

2. Java EE(Enterprise Edition)
Used to develop web/business/enterprise applications
Mainly focuses on Advanced and Enterprise

3. Java ME (Micro/Mobile Edition)
used to develop mobile applications (eg: mobile gaming App)

-----------------------------------------------

what is difference between JDK,JRE and JVM?

There are different JRK for different Operating Systems, that should be installed to run the .class file
1. JDK (Java Development Kit)

-Provides base tools (compilers,debuggers) that enable java developers to develop applications

2. JRE (JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMET)
-A JRE is made up of a Java virtual machine (JVM), Java class libraries, and the Java class loader.
-Provies supporting libraries/JAR files which can be used during run time.

     JAR - JAVA ARCHIVE - contains .class files
         - .class file holds "byte code" which generated by java compiler

3. JVM - (Java Virtual Machine)
-provides an environemt/platform where java applications are executed

----------------------------------------------
what is data types in java?

Java is static typing language where as python is dynamic typing language

Statically typed programming languages do type checking at compile-time.
Examples: Java, C, C++.

Dynamically typed programming languages do type checking at run-time.
Examples: Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, JavaScript

Java is a strongly typed programming language because every variable must be declared with a data type. A variable cannot start off life without knowing the range of values it can hold, and once it is declared, the data type of the variable cannot change.

Pyton is loosly type language no need to declare data types
--------------------------------------------------------
Following data types called as “Primitve” Data types 

1. Integer category

-byte : 8 bits
-short : 16 bits
-int : 32 bits
-long : 64  bits

Range of byte datatypes : -128 to +127

ex: byte X = 127;
		System.out.println(x); //output : 127

    byte Y =128;
	System.out.println(Y); //output : Error

   byte z = (byte)128;
	System.out.println(z); //output : -128 
//tries to fit in the negative side

     byte w = (byte)129;
	System.out.println(w); //output : -127
//going to 0
    
	byte m = (byte)1000;
	System.out.println(m); //output : undefined

Note: byte is normally used in socket programing
---------------------------
2. Floating point - to store franctional/decimal point values

	-float - 16 bits

	-double - 64 bits
	
example:

float a = 10.5; //error 

because by default fractional values are promoted to be consider as double. since float size is lesser than double, 

10.5 in right hand side taken as double value, left side "a" taken as float. literally we assign double value to float. which gives an overflow error.

how to overcome;
float a = 10.5F; //telling as consider this as float (put F)1, flot value 10.5 assign to float "a".

System.out.printlin(a); //output: 10.5
    
-----------------

3. Character

char : 16 bits (ASCII range : 0-65535)

// java supports UNICODE (universal character code) character-set  and char datatype allows us to store UNICODE

char ch = ‘A’; //single cotation

System.out.println((int) ch); //gives ASCII value 65

NOTE: char is unsigned value where you don’t find negative values)

----------------
4. Boolean

boolean : 1 bit 

NOTE: boolean datatype accepts only "true" or “false” in word format.

boolean a = True; //Error (java is case sensetive)

boolean a = true;//correct

NOTE: All the above data types are known as “premitive” data types, and represented in lower-case only.

NOTE: All fractional values are "double" by default

------------------------------------------------

what is a variable ?

A place holder/ container used to store values 

-----------------------------------------
List of operators;

1.Arithmatic : +,-,*,/,%


2. Relational operators

>,<,>=,<=,!=,==

3. Boolean logical

&,|,! (not operator)


4. Bitwise : low- level operators because these operators operates based on bits (1 and 0)

&,|,!,^,<<,>>,>>>

5.Increment/decrement

++,--

6. short-circuit operators

&&,||

7. Assignment 

=,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=

-------------------------------------------

List of control structures and statement

1. Selection / Conditional / If statements

if, if else, if else if, Nested if, switch case

---Nested if--------------------

if (Con 1){

	if (Con 2){
     
      }
}

----------switch-case------------

switch(Expression){

case val1: 

		break;
case val2:
            break;

 default:

}




2. Iteration statements/Loops

while, do while, for, 
enhanced for (Foreach) - available since java 1.5

3. Termination/jump statements

return, break, continue

-----------------------------------

syntax of loops


while (con){


}


do{

//Block of code

} while(con);

//do-while executes the program statements at least regardless of condition status

ex: oyter ticket machine, user cannot do something without display anything


--------------------------------
int a = 10; // declaration and initialization
int c; // declaration only
