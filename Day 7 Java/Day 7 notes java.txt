what is a program?

A set of instructions wriiten to solve a given problem.


why programming?

offers to way to solve a given problem
A problem solving Technique (PST)
Automation

--------------------------------
types of programming languages

1. Procedural Oriented Languages : this has a sequential approach and not suitable for real-world use-case.
   
 example:   C language

2. Object-Oriented Languages: can take real-world objects in non-sequental manner, better maintainance, re-usable, can intergrate different objects, random creation

 example:  C++,Java,Python,c# (find different between these languages)

spending time developing with java is higher than python but java execution time is lesser than python because python takes time to execute.

3. Functional Programming Languages

  Scala (this is the next level of java developers can learn)
  less number of key stroke required for scala than java.
  good for ML projects


Types of translators in programming domain
-------------------------------------------
Source code : written by developer using high-level languages
Machine language : low-level language which is understanable to machines

1. Compiler : Faster, compiles the code from one format to another format (High -level to low-level)

2. Interpreter: Slower than compiler because it interprets the code line-by-line

Java uses both translators

------------------------------------------------
What is java programming?

java was developed at Sun Microsystems
since oracle acquired Sun Microsystems java product is under the control of Oracle

----------------------------------------------------
Features of java programming

1. Simple to learn by the learners who have some knowledge.

2. java has back-ward compatible, they can easily change the version(new versions possible), but python still has 3 versions because it is not back-ward compatible and have lot of dependecies to build a new version.

3.Portable : Platform-independent (can run on different machines with different OS)

4. Secure: java wants to avoid .exe files because .exe files can easily attack by attackers.
java .class files is not allow modification (ensure integrity), if modified java interpreter (interpreter will see the modification) will not allow you to execute the file. 

5. Multi-threaded : improving the performance of the application.

Very first java program

Steps involved:

1. write a java code (source code) and save it in <filename>.java

In order to open cmd, just go the file folder and type cmd in the location bar. it automatically open the cmd with current location

2. Compile the source code using java compiler. 

> javac <filename>.java

3. Execute or Run the code/application

>java <classname>

------------------------------------------------------------------

In test file;

there are 3 classes mentioned : First, String, System

Class is a blueprint of a real-world object.

.class file : bytecode where we can run on any paltform

if you modify code make sure to compile it and run.
