what is Jira and Confluence ?

Jira is a bug tracking tool / workflow management tool / project management tool.

Jira allows us to create various project boards such as kanban,scrum  and srumban (combination of kanban and scurm)

Kanban : will have no fixed time bounds(no pressure in deadline) 
scrum : There will be fixed time bounds which are called as sprints. each sprint may last long for at least 2 weeks.

sprint may have one or more tasks/issues/tickets that needs to be completed within a sprint

srumban is a combination of kanban and scrum

Trello is another tool as jira but not popular in industry
-----------------------------------------------
confluence: tool which mainly used for documentation 

documentation: can be a guide to install software, details about bugs,scrum meeting content so absentees can see the doc and understand the status.
