use constructors to initialized at the first stage of creating objects. which you cannot change the values later on in the program

setters used when you need to change aruguments in anytime in the code.

----------------------------------------
Garbage Collector will take care of internal remove of objects (see the pic in this folder how a3 = 200 will be unlinked)

java has GC where as c++ and C we have to take care of object remove from heap.

What is an Inheritance?

A process of creating new class from an existing class.

Here, new class is called as "sub-class/derived class/child class".

where as an existing class "Super class/base class/parent class".

-----------------------------------------------

In OOP classes can have two types of asscoiations/relationships?

1. Is-a relationship - Inheritance

2. Has-a relationship - Aggregation/Composition

example:

class Address{

}

 class Employee{

     int empId;
     String empName;

     Address address; // Has-a relationship
}

//Manager is an Employee
class Manager extends Employee{ // Is-a relationship

}

-----------------------------------------------

Can child class inherits the parent class private variables?

No. but by using parent class constructor you can invoke them.

ex. super(empId,empName);
---------------------------------------------

****Inheritance is always from parent to child

---------------------------------------------
If there is no method in child class then main method will look at the parent class for that method.

Manager getDetails() deleted, so main will look at getDetails() in parent class.
